This project is completed as entry task for my internship.
It is similar to task 3 of 2023 advent of coding.

task assignment:

Your coworker needs you to count the numbers of active containers. To do this, you will need his map, which you can find attached to this task. Let's look at the following example:

467..257..
...*......
..35..633.
......#...
617*......
.....+.13.
..592.....
......755.
...$.*....
.664.598..
The map shows a lot of numbers and symbols that you don't fully understand. However, that doesn't matter, because as he reveals, every number that is adjacent to a symbol, even diagonally, is an active container number and must be counted in the final sum (Dots (.) are not considered symbols).

In the example map, there are two numbers that are not active container numbers, as they are not adjacent to any symbols: 257 (top right) and 13 (middle right). All other numbers are adjacent to a symbol and therefore are active container numbers; their sum is 4361.

Input data:
Coworker's real map is of course much larger and can be found embedded in this document and also attached for good measure.

What is the sum of the active container numbers on Eda's map?
